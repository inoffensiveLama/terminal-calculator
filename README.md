# Overview

This is a calculator that runs in the terminal. It allows you to calculate the basic operations (addition, subtraction, division and multiplication). It creates a new object for each calculation and stores them all in a list, which in the end the program iterates over the list and prints out all calculations. The program checks if the user wants to divide by zero and will ask for different numbers. Also there is error handling if the user is asking for something beside the 4 basic operations.

I wanted to exlore the C++ language and include a couple of important core concepts the language has to offer. 


# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code. I installed the extensions for C++ and the extension code runner, so I could run the code in Visual Studio Code, instead of having to compile them manually each time.

I wrote the program in C++. I used the standard input output library (iostream), as well as the list library.

# Future Work

- I would like to include a check if the operands are actually numbers in the future.
